# [chessground-anim](https://leodog896.github.io/chessground-anim) (still building!)

any-move chess animation system - easily animate PGN games with custom rules

## Acknowledgements
- Chess board from [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground).
- PGN layouts inspired by [chess-pgn-viewer](https://github.com/lichess-org/pgn-viewer).

> **Note** chessground currently has a layout-shift problem, so in order to fix weird mouse movement, zoom in and zoom out. I'll triage this once I get the chance.
